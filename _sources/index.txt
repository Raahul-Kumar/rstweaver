rstweaver
=========

``rstweaver`` is a framework for building reST directives that support literate
programming, in a style similar to `Sweave
<http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_.

Nice features:

- These are just ``reST`` directives -- they will integrate into any system
  that uses reST. ``rstweaver`` itself is documented using ``rstweaver`` in
  `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
- Largely language agnostic. As I write this, it supports Haskell, C++, Python
  and reST itself.
- Rather than the typical "document is a source file" model, in ``rstweaver`` a
  document *manages* source files -- several of them, in possibly multiple
  languages. They can be build, executed, changed, reexecuted. This has both
  advantages and disadvantages, but it is nearly essentially for very static
  compiled languages to be nice in literate code.
- Because it is pure docutils, it should be possible to produce output in any
  format that docutils supports.
- Results are cached across runs, so rerunning the same document multiple times
  with minor changes near the end (which is how I use it) is fast.

Features which are noticeably missing:

- Plots
