Library dependencies
====================

1. `treewatcher <https://github.com/ellbur/treewatcher>`_ - ``treewatcher``
   also uses `pyinotify <https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify>`_ which uses  the
   ``inotify`` Linux system call, so it will only run on Linux.

2. `*my* docutils <https://github.com/ellbur/docutils>`_ - because I fixed some
   bugs and added some features that ``rstweaver`` uses. This was a
   questionable decision. For my thoughts on it see `Welcome to my github world
   <>`_.

3. `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_
