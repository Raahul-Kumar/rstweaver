rstweaver
=========

``rstweaver`` is a framework for building reST directives that support literate
programming, in a style similar to `Sweave
<http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_.

Because these are just reST directives, they should integrate into any system
that uses reST. ``rstweaver`` itself is documented using ``rstweaver`` in
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. Unfortunately only HTML output is
supported right now, though that shouldn't be too complicated to change.
