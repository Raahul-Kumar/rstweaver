rstweaver
~~~~~~~~~

``rstweaver`` is a set of reST directives aimed at producing an effect similar
to `Sweave <http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_.

``rstweaver`` differs from ``Sweave`` in one significant way: in order to get
an effect similar to "interactive" sessions for manifestly non-interactive
languages (my particular motivation was Haskell), ``rstweaver`` supports
incremental building, modifying and executing of multiple named files.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `treewatcher <https://github.com/ellbur/treewatcher>`_ - ``treewatcher``
   also uses `pyinotify <https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify>`_ which uses  the
   ``inotify`` Linux system call, so it will only run on Linux.

2. `*my* docutils <https://github.com/ellbur/docutils>`_ - because I fixed some
   bugs and added some features that ``rstweaver`` uses. This was a
   questionable decision. For my thoughts on it see `Welcome to my github world
   <>`_.

3. `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::
	
	sudo python setup.py install

Contents
~~~~~~~~

This distribution contains two things:

1. A library for writing reST directives to support literate programming.
2. A terribly minimal program ``rstweave`` for converting reST documents to
   HTML using these directives.

Supported Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently:

* Haskell
* C++
* Python
* reST

But adding languages is easy.

Hacking
~~~~~~~

The code is an utter mess. The parts necessary to write new directives should
be decently documented. I welcome any changes -- you can't possibly make it
worse.
