rstweaver
~~~~~~~~~

``rstweaver`` is a set of reST directives aimed at producing an effect similar
to `Sweave <http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_.

``rstweaver`` differs from ``Sweave`` in one significant way: in order to get
an effect similar to "interactive" sessions for manifestly non-interactive
languages (my particular motivation was Haskell), ``rstweaver`` supports
incremental building, modifying and executing of multiple named files.

Right now, unfortunately, ouput is fairly HTML specific, because that's all
I've needed. It shouldn't be too hard to make it use more general ``docutils``
elements, but I know very little about ``docutils``.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::
	
	sudo python setup.py install

Or see INSTALL.

Contents
~~~~~~~~

This distribution contains two things:

1. A library for writing reST directives to support literate programming.
2. A terribly minimal program ``rstweave`` for converting reST documents to
   HTML using these directives.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`http://ellbur.github.com/rstweaver/ <http://ellbur.github.com/rstweaver/>`_

Supported Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently:

* Haskell

But adding languages is easy.

Hacking
~~~~~~~

The code is an utter mess. The parts necessary to write new directives should
be decently documented. I welcome any changes -- you can't possible make it
worse.
