rstweaver
~~~~~~~~~

``rstweaver`` is a set of reST directives aimed at producing an effect similar
to `Sweave <http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_.

``rstweaver`` differs from ``Sweave`` in one significant way: in order to get
an effect similar to "interactive" sessions for manifestly non-interactive
languages (my particular motivation was Haskell), ``rstweaver`` supports
incremental building, modifying and executing of multiple named files.

Right now, unfortunately, ouput is fairly HTML specific, because that's all
I've needed. It shouldn't be too hard to make it use more general ``docutils``
elements, but I know very little about ``docutils``.
